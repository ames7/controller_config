# Controller Config
A repo to hold Ansible Controller config stuff

Vars needed (I added them in as extra vars in the AAP console at runtime): 

- controller_host1: FQDN of the controller you are pulling the config from 

- controller_host2: FQDN of the controller you are copying the config to

- controller_token1: oauth token of controller1

- controller_token2: oauth token of controller2
